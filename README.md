# DeTrade Fund - Website Frontend Architecture

This is the **marketing website and landing page** for DeTrade Fund, built with SvelteKit. It serves as the primary showcase for the DeFi platform, featuring real-time vault metrics, dynamic APR displays, and comprehensive information about DeTrade's investment strategies. The actual trading application is accessible at [app.detrade.fund](https://app.detrade.fund).

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a modern, component-based architecture designed for optimal performance and user engagement. The frontend serves as a sophisticated **marketing interface** that displays real-time financial data, vault performance metrics, and guides users toward the main DeTrade application.

### Core Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit
- Chosen for its compile-time optimizations and minimal runtime overhead
- Server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance
- Built-in routing and API handling

**UI/UX Design Philosophy**:
- Glassmorphism design with backdrop filters for modern aesthetics
- 3D transforms and animations for engaging user interactions
- Mobile-first responsive design with fluid typography
- Dark theme optimized for financial data visualization

**Animation & Interactions**:
- Svelte's built-in transition system for smooth animations
- Intersection Observer API for performance-optimized scroll animations
- Custom easing functions (quintOut) for professional feel
- Hardware-accelerated transforms for 60fps animations

## Component Architecture

### Core Components Structure

```
src/lib/components/
├── Header.svelte          # Navigation with dynamic TVL display
├── Hero.svelte            # Landing section with real-time APR data
├── About.svelte           # Company information and target segments
├── Vaults.svelte          # Vault cards with live metrics
├── Strategies.svelte      # Carousel showcasing investment strategies
├── Lagoon.svelte          # Technology partnership section
├── CTA.svelte             # Call-to-action section
├── Footer.svelte          # Footer with social links
└── NumberRoll.svelte      # Animated number transitions
```

### Design Patterns

**Reactive Data Flow**: Each component manages its own state and API calls, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

**Performance Optimization**: 
- Lazy loading with Intersection Observer
- Staggered animations to reduce computation load
- Efficient DOM updates through Svelte's reactivity

**Responsive Design**: 
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Fluid typography using clamp() functions

## API Architecture

### Endpoint Structure

```
src/routes/api/
├── apr/+server.ts         # 30-day APR calculations
├── tvl/+server.ts         # Total Value Locked per vault
├── total-tvl/+server.ts   # Aggregated TVL across all vaults
└── price/[token]/+server.ts # Real-time token price feeds
```

### Data Flow & Sources

**Primary Data Sources**:
- **Vault Metrics**: `https://app.detrade.fund/api/vaults`
- **Price Feeds**: `https://app.detrade.fund/api/price`
- **APR Calculations**: 30-day rolling averages with compound interest

**API Design Principles**:
- RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling
- Parallel data fetching for optimal performance
- Type-safe responses with proper error propagation
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Database Strategy (MongoDB)

### Data Models

**Vault Performance Metrics**:
```typescript
interface VaultMetrics {
  vaultId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  totalAssets: number;
  apr: number;
  tvl: number;
  underlyingToken: string;
  strategies: Strategy[];
}
```

**Token Price History**:
```typescript
interface PriceData {
  token: string;
  price: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  source: string;
  volume24h?: number;
}
```

**User Analytics** (Future Implementation):
```typescript
interface UserInteraction {
  sessionId: string;
  action: string;
  componentId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Data Sourcing Strategy

**Real-time Data Pipeline**:
1. **Vault Metrics**: Sourced from Lagoon Finance APIs every 5 minutes
2. **Price Data**: Multiple DEX aggregators for accurate pricing
3. **APR Calculations**: Historical performance data with risk-adjusted returns
4. **TVL Aggregation**: Cross-vault calculations for total fund size

**Data Validation**:
- Input sanitization for all external API responses
- Fallback mechanisms for data source failures
- Consistency checks across related metrics

## Performance & Optimization

### Frontend Optimizations

**Bundle Size Management**:
- Tree-shaking for unused code elimination
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Optimized asset loading with proper caching headers

**Runtime Performance**:
- Efficient reactivity with Svelte's compiler optimizations
- Minimal DOM manipulation through virtual DOM diffing
- Prefetch strategies for critical resources

**SEO & Accessibility**:
- Server-side rendering for all content
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- Open Graph and Twitter Card optimization

### Backend Optimizations

**API Response Times**:
- Parallel data fetching reduces latency by ~60%
- Response caching for frequently accessed endpoints
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful degradation for failed API calls
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages with fallback content

## Security Implementation

### Data Protection

**API Security**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

**Client-side Security**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external dependencies
- Secure cookie handling for session management

### Integration Security

**Lagoon Finance Integration**:
- Multi-signature wallet integration
